    <description>Manually finding drivers for Windows takes forever. And sometimes you still don't find what you need. Driver Easy changes all that. It scans your computer, tells you what drivers are missing or outdated, then downloads them all, in one go. All you have to do is click your mouse button twice. Then, you'll be good to go.
